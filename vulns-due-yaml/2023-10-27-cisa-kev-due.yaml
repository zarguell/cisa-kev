  dateAdded: '2023-10-23'
  shortDescription: Cisco IOS XE contains a command injection vulnerability in the
    web user interface. When chained with CVE-2023-20198, the attacker can leverage
    the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file
    system. Cisco identified CVE-2023-20273 as the vulnerability exploited to deploy
    the implant. CVE-2021-1435, previously associated with the exploitation events,
    is no longer believed to be related to this activity.

    report positive findings to CISA.
